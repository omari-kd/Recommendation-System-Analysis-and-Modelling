> # **Introduction**
>
> Recommendation systems are essential for delivering personalised user experiences across a variety of platforms, including e-commerce, streaming services, social media and news websites.
>
> This project aims to develop a recommendation system that leveraged historical user data to provide tailored recommendations across different domains, such as product recommendations, content suggestions and service optimisation.
>
> ## **CRISP DM Framework**
>
> The analysis followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following stages:
>
> ### **1. Business Understanding:**
>
> The objectives were defined below, followed by the formulation of analytic questions to guide the modelling process.
>
> Key objectives of the project include:
>
> 1.Develop Personalized Recommendations: Tailor suggestions based on user behaviour and past interactions.
>
> 2.Address Diverse Use Cases: Implement systems for product, content and service recommendations.
>
> 3.Utilize Historical Data: Leverage past user actions to make accurate predictions.
>
> 4.Enhance User Engagement: Improve user satisfaction and retention through relevant suggestions.
>
> 5.Ensure Scalability & Real-Time Performance: Handle large data volumes and provide recommendations promptly.
>
> 6.Boost Business Metrics: Increase sales and conversion rates through better user personalization.
>
> 7.Balance Accuracy & Diversity: Provide relevant but varied recommendations to avoid monotony.
>

> Analytic Questions:**\
> **
>
> ### **2. Data Understanding:**
>
> The dataset consists of three files: events.csv, item_properties.csv and category_tree.csv, which collectively describe the interactions and properties of items on an e-commerce website. The data, collected over a 4.5-month period, is raw and contains hashed values due to confidentiality concerns. The goal of publishing this dataset is to support research in recommender systems using implicit feedback.
>
> 2.1 Behaviour Data (events.csv)
>
> The behaviour data includes a total of 2,756,101 events, with 2,664,312 views, 69,332 add-to-cart actions, and 22,457 transactions, recorded from 1,407,580 unique visitors. Each event corresponds to one of three types of interactions: "view", "addtocart", or "transaction". These implicit feedback signals are crucial for recommender systems:
>
> View: Represents a user showing interest in an item.
>
> Add to Cart: Indicates a higher level of intent to purchase.
>
> Transaction: Represents a completed purchase.
>
> 2.2 Item Properties (item_properties.csv)
>
> This file contains 20,275,902 rows, representing various properties of 417,053 unique items. Each property may change over time (e.g., price updates), with each row capturing a snapshot of an itemâ€™s property at a specific timestamp. For items with constant properties, only a single snapshot is recorded. The file is split into two due to its size, and it contains detailed item information, which is essential for building item profiles and understanding how item properties influence user behaviour.

**Conversion Rates**

Integrating conversion rates in the analysis is key, as it helps to to segment users, compare against normal behaviour or as additional features in your recommendation or anomaly detection models.

Also tracking conversion rates can help you detect issues or improvements in your user funnel and overall system performance.

Lastly, If there is a suspiscion of some users are bots, you might compare their conversion rates with genuine users to see if there are significant differences, which further validates the bot detection.

```{r}
# Count the number of each event per visitor
user_event_counts <- dcast(events, visitorid ~ event, fun.aggregate = length, value.var = "event", fill = 0)
setnames(user_event_counts, old = c("view", "addtocart", "transaction"),
         new = c("num_view", "num_addtocart", "num_transaction"))


setDT(user_event_counts)
# Calculate conversion rates per visitor
user_event_counts[, conversion_view_to_add := ifelse(num_view > 0, num_addtocart / num_view, 0)]
user_event_counts[, conversion_add_to_transaction := ifelse(num_addtocart > 0, num_transaction / num_addtocart, 0)]
user_event_counts[, conversion_view_to_transaction := ifelse(num_view > 0, num_transaction / num_view, 0)]

# Inspect the calculated conversion rates
head(user_event_counts)
```

> ### **Abnormal Bot Users Detection**
>
> **Strategies for Bot Detection**
>
> **Event Frequency and Volume:**
>
> -   **High Activity:** Bots may generate a significantly higher number of events (e.g., views, add-to-carts, transactions) than typical users in a short time frame.
>
> -   **Event Density:** Calculate the number of events per minute or per session. Extremely high densities can signal bot behaviour.

 # --------------------------------------
# Abnormally Detection

# setnames
# setnames(events, c("timestamp", "visitorid", "event", "itemid", "transaction"))

# Calculate event frequency per visitor (total events, events per minute, etc.)
# Assuming events are sorted by timestamp for each visitor
setorder(events, visitorid, timestamp)

# Calculate the time difference between consecutive events for each visitor
events[, time_diff := as.numeric(difftime(timestamp, shift(timestamp), units = "secs")), by = visitorid]

# Aggregate statistics per visitor: total events, median time difference, etc.
visitor_stats <- events[, .(
  total_events = .N,
  avg_time_diff = mean(time_diff, na.rm = TRUE),
  median_time_diff = median(time_diff, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = visitorid]

# Identify potential bots:
# For instance, flag users with unusually high total events or very low average time difference.
# These thresholds may need tuning based on your data.
# Calculate thresholds while removing NA values
bot_threshold_events <- quantile(visitor_stats$total_events, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)   # Top 5% activity
bot_threshold_time <- quantile(visitor_stats$avg_time_diff, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)      # Bottom 5% time gaps

```

> **Time Difference Calculation:**\
> By computing the time difference between consecutive events, one can observe if some visitors have extremely short intervals between actions which is manchester uniteda common bot behaviours.
>
> **\
> Aggregation and Thresholds:**\
> Aggregating by visitor allows the computation of overall activity metrics (e.g., total events, average time between events). Setting thresholds based on quantiles (e.g., top 5% for total events, bottom 5% for average time difference) provides a starting point for flagging anomalies

```{r}

# ------------------------------
# Remove Bots
# -------------------------------

# Remove events associated with bot users from the events data
# clean_events_df <- events[!visitorid %in% potential_bots$visitorid]

# Verify how many events remain after removing bot-related events
# cat("Number of events after removing bots:", nrow(clean_events_df), "\n")

```

> **Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection**
>
> This step adds a sophisticated, model-based layer of bot detection on top of the simple activity threshold.

```{r}
# ---------------------------------------
# Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection
# ---------------------------------------

# Prepare features for the Isolation Forest model.
# Use the aggregated metrics: total_events, avg_time_diff, and median_time_diff.
features <- as.data.frame(visitor_stats[, .(total_events, avg_time_diff, median_time_diff)])

# Check structure of features to ensure all columns are numeric
str(features)

# Initialize and fit the Isolation Forest model.
iso_model <- isolation.forest(features, ntrees = 100, sample_size = nrow(features), seed = 42)

# Get predictions which include an anomaly score for each user.
predictions <- predict(iso_model, newdata = features)

# Debugging: Check the structure and content of predictions.
str(predictions)
head(predictions)

# If predictions is an atomic vector of numeric values, add it directly.
visitor_stats[, anomaly_score := predictions]

# Define an anomaly threshold: Flag users whose anomaly score is in the top 1% as anomalies.
anomaly_threshold <- quantile(predictions, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)
visitor_stats[, anomaly_flag := ifelse(anomaly_score > anomaly_threshold, -1, 1)]

# Check the updated visitor_stats
print(head(visitor_stats))

```

```{r}
# -----------------------------
# STEP 6: Combine Detection Criteria
# -----------------------------
# Define thresholds for rule-based bot detection
bot_threshold_events <- quantile(visitor_stats$total_events, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)
bot_threshold_time <- quantile(visitor_stats$avg_time_diff, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create the bot_flag_rule column based on the thresholds
visitor_stats[, bot_flag_rule := (total_events > bot_threshold_events) | (avg_time_diff < bot_threshold_time)]


# Define a final flag for bots:
# A visitor is flagged as a bot if they meet either the rule-based criteria or the Isolation Forest criteria.
visitor_stats[, final_bot_flag := (bot_flag_rule == TRUE) | (anomaly_flag == -1)]

# Identify the final list of bot users.
bot_users <- visitor_stats[final_bot_flag == TRUE]
print(paste("Number of bots detected (combined):", nrow(bot_users)))

# -----------------------------
# STEP 7: Filter Out Bot Users from Events Data
# -----------------------------

# Remove all events associated with flagged bot users.
cleaned_events <- events[!visitorid %in% bot_users$visitorid]

# Optionally, check how many unique users remain.
print(paste("Remaining unique users after bot removal:", uniqueN(cleaned_events$visitorid)))

```

**Visualizing Bot Detection Results**

```{r}
# Density plot of anomaly scores
ggplot(visitor_stats, aes(x = anomaly_score, fill = factor(final_bot_flag))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Density of Anomaly Scores", x = "Anomaly Score", fill = "Bot Flag") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Scatter Plot of User Activity versus Time Difference**

Examine the relationship between the number of events and the average time difference per user. Bots might show distinct patterns compared to regular users.

```{r}
# Assuming visitor_stats already contains total_events and avg_time_diff
ggplot(visitor_stats, aes(x = total_events, y = avg_time_diff)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "purple") +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale if there's a wide range in total_events
  labs(title = "Total Events vs. Average Time Difference per User",
       x = "Total Events (log scale)", y = "Average Time Difference (seconds)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

**Data Visualisation after Anomaly Detection**

```{r}
# Data Visualisation
options(scipen = 999)

events_counts <- cleaned_events %>% 
  group_by(event) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())

events_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = event, y = count, fill = event)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = NA, width = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, color = "black") +
  ylim (0, 3000000) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of User Events After Bots Removal",
    x = "Event Type",
    y = "Count"
  )

```

The charts show the distribution of user events after removing bots. The events tracked are 'view', 'addtocart' and 'transaction'.

**Key Findings:**

-   **Views**:

    -   Before bot removal: 2,664,218

    -   After bot removal: 1,817,072

    -   **Drop**: 847,146 (31.8% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: A significant portion of views were bot-generated, indicating inflated traffic metrics.

-   **Addtocart**:

    -   Before bot removal: 68,966

    -   After bot removal: 22,947

    -   **Drop**: 46,019 (66.7% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: Bots contributed to addtocart actions, but less so compared to views.

-   **Transactions**:

    -   Before bot removal: 22,457

    -   After bot removal: 5,392

    -   **Drop**: 17,065 (75.9% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: Transactions were less affected by bots, suggesting more genuine human actions.

Analysis:

The large drop in views suggests that the website's traffic was significantly inflated by bots, which could affect advertising revenue and perceived popularity.

The drop in addtocart events indicates that user engagement might be lower than initially thought, suggesting a need to improve the user experience or product offerings.

The 75.9% reduction means that bots contributed heavily to transaction counts, but the remaining transactions after bot removal are likely more reliable as genuine human activity. This makes transactions a more trustworthy metric for evaluating real user behaviour, even though the absolute drop was large.

# Even though many values in the file are hashed to protect confidentiality, not all values are treated the same way. 

# Text or categorical values are hashed to anonymize the data. These values arenâ€™t meant to be interpreted numerically.

# Certain properties like price or other quantitative attributes are meant to be used in calculations. These numeric values are stored with an "n" prefix (e.g., "n5.000") to denote that they are numbers with a specific precision. They are not hashed; they're just formatted as strings with that prefix.
