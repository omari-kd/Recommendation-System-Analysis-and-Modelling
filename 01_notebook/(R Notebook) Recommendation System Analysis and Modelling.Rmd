> # **Introduction**
>
> Recommendation systems are essential for delivering personalised user experiences across a variety of platforms, including e-commerce, streaming services, social media and news websites.
>
> This project aims to develop a recommendation system that leveraged historical user data to provide tailored recommendations across different domains, such as product recommendations, content suggestions and service optimisation.
>
> ## **CRISP DM Framework**
>
> The analysis followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following stages:
>
> ### **1. Business Understanding:**
>
> The objectives were defined below, followed by the formulation of analytic questions to guide the modelling process.
>
> Key objectives of the project include:
>
> 1.Develop Personalized Recommendations: Tailor suggestions based on user behaviour and past interactions.
>
> 2.Address Diverse Use Cases: Implement systems for product, content and service recommendations.
>
> 3.Utilize Historical Data: Leverage past user actions to make accurate predictions.
>
> 4.Enhance User Engagement: Improve user satisfaction and retention through relevant suggestions.
>
> 5.Ensure Scalability & Real-Time Performance: Handle large data volumes and provide recommendations promptly.
>
> 6.Boost Business Metrics: Increase sales and conversion rates through better user personalization.
>
> 7.Balance Accuracy & Diversity: Provide relevant but varied recommendations to avoid monotony.
>
> \
> Analytic Questions:\
> a. How effective is the user funnel?
>
> b\. What are the trends in user activity over time?
>
> c\. When are users most active?
>
> d\. How does the availability of items impact user interactions?
>
> e\. How do conversion rates vary across different times of the day?
>
> f\. What is the relationship between user session duration and purchase likelihood?
>
> g\. What is the distribution of event types across all users?
>
> ### **2. Data Understanding:**
>
> The dataset consists of three files: events.csv, item_properties.csv and category_tree.csv, which collectively describe the interactions and properties of items on an e-commerce website. The data, collected over a 4.5-month period, is raw and contains hashed values due to confidentiality concerns. The goal of publishing this dataset is to support research in recommender systems using implicit feedback.
>
> 2.1 Behaviour Data (events.csv)
>
> The behaviour data includes a total of 2,756,101 events, with 2,664,312 views, 69,332 add-to-cart actions, and 22,457 transactions, recorded from 1,407,580 unique visitors. Each event corresponds to one of three types of interactions: "view", "addtocart", or "transaction". These implicit feedback signals are crucial for recommender systems:
>
> View: Represents a user showing interest in an item.
>
> Add to Cart: Indicates a higher level of intent to purchase.
>
> Transaction: Represents a completed purchase.
>
> 2.2 Item Properties (item_properties.csv)
>
> This file contains 20,275,902 rows, representing various properties of 417,053 unique items. Each property may change over time (e.g., price updates), with each row capturing a snapshot of an itemâ€™s property at a specific timestamp. For items with constant properties, only a single snapshot is recorded. The file is split into two due to its size, and it contains detailed item information, which is essential for building item profiles and understanding how item properties influence user behaviour.

It's a model used to understand how potential customers move through different stages towards conversion, which is typically a sale but can also be any other desired action like signing up for a newsletter, downloading a whitepaper, purchasing product, et.)

**Conversion Rates**

Integrating conversion rates in the analysis is key, as it helps to to segment users, compare against normal behaviour or as additional features in your recommendation or anomaly detection models.

Also tracking conversion rates can help you detect issues or improvements in your user funnel and overall system performance.

Lastly, If there is a suspicion of some users are bots, you might compare their conversion rates with genuine users to see if there are significant differences, which further validates the bot detection.

```{r}
# Count the number of each event per visitor
user_event_counts <- dcast(events, visitorid ~ event, fun.aggregate = length, value.var = "event", fill = 0)
setnames(user_event_counts, old = c("view", "addtocart", "transaction"),
         new = c("num_view", "num_addtocart", "num_transaction"))


setDT(user_event_counts)
# Calculate conversion rates per visitor
user_event_counts[, conversion_view_to_add := ifelse(num_view > 0, num_addtocart / num_view, 0)]
user_event_counts[, conversion_add_to_transaction := ifelse(num_addtocart > 0, num_transaction / num_addtocart, 0)]
user_event_counts[, conversion_view_to_transaction := ifelse(num_view > 0, num_transaction / num_view, 0)]

# Inspect the calculated conversion rates
head(user_event_counts)
```

```{r}
# Histogram for the view-to-add conversion rate

> ### **Abnormal Bot Users Detection**
>
> **Strategies for Bot Detection**
>
> **Event Frequency and Volume:**
>
> -   **High Activity:** Bots may generate a significantly higher number of events (e.g., views, add-to-carts, transactions) than typical users in a short time frame.
>
> -   **Event Density:** Calculate the number of events per minute or per session. Extremely high densities can signal bot behaviour.

# Aggregate statistics per visitor: total events, median time difference, etc.
visitor_stats <- events[, .(
  total_events = .N,
  avg_time_diff = mean(time_diff, na.rm = TRUE),
  median_time_diff = median(time_diff, na.rm = TRUE)

# Identify potential bots:
# For instance, flag users with unusually high total events or very low average time difference.
# These thresholds may need tuning based on your data.
# Calculate thresholds while removing NA values
bot_threshold_events <- quantile(visitor_stats$total_events, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)   # Top 5% activity

> **Time Difference Calculation:**\
> By computing the time difference between consecutive events, one can observe if some visitors have extremely short intervals between actions which is manchester uniteda common bot behaviours.
>
> **\
> Aggregation and Thresholds:**\
> Aggregating by visitor allows the computation of overall activity metrics (e.g., total events, average time between events). Setting thresholds based on quantiles (e.g., top 5% for total events, bottom 5% for average time difference) provides a starting point for flagging anomalies

```{r}

# ------------------------------
# Remove Bots
# -------------------------------

# Remove events associated with bot users from the events data
# clean_events_df <- events[!visitorid %in% potential_bots$visitorid]

# Verify how many events remain after removing bot-related events
# cat("Number of events after removing bots:", nrow(clean_events_df), "\n")

```

> **Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection**
>
> This step adds a sophisticated, model-based layer of bot detection on top of the simple activity threshold.

```{r}
# ---------------------------------------
# Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection
# ---------------------------------------

# Use the aggregated metrics: total_events, avg_time_diff, and median_time_diff.

# -----------------------------
# STEP 6: Combine Detection Criteria

bot_threshold_time <- quantile(visitor_stats$avg_time_diff, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create the bot_flag_rule column based on the thresholds
visitor_stats[, bot_flag_rule := (total_events > bot_threshold_events) | (avg_time_diff < bot_threshold_time)]


# Define a final flag for bots:
# A visitor is flagged as a bot if they meet either the rule-based criteria or the Isolation Forest criteria.
visitor_stats[, final_bot_flag := (bot_flag_rule == TRUE) | (anomaly_flag == -1)]

# Identify the final list of bot users.
bot_users <- visitor_stats[final_bot_flag == TRUE]

# -----------------------------
# STEP 7: Filter Out Bot Users from Events Data

```

**Scatter Plot of User Activity versus Time Difference**

Examine the relationship between the number of events and the average time difference per user. Bots might show distinct patterns compared to regular users.

```{r}
# ------------------------------------------------------
#  Scatter Plot of User Activity versus Time Difference
# ------------------------------------------------------

# Assuming visitor_stats already contains total_events and avg_time_diff
ggplot(visitor_stats, aes(x = total_events, y = avg_time_diff)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "purple") +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale if there's a wide range in total_events
  labs(title = "Total Events vs. Average Time Difference per User",
       x = "Total Events (log scale)", y = "Average Time Difference (seconds)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

**Data Visualisation after Anomaly Detection**

```{r}
# ----------------------------------------------------

# ----------------------------------------------------
options(scipen = 999)

events_counts <- cleaned_events %>% 
  group_by(event) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())

events_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = event, y = count, fill = event)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = NA, width = 0.7) +
  #geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, color = "black") +
  ylim (0, 3000000) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of User Events After Bots Removal",
    x = "Event Type",
    y = "Count"
  )

```

The charts show the distribution of user events after removing bots. The events tracked are 'view', 'addtocart' and 'transaction'.

**Key Findings:**

-   **Views**:

    -   Before bot removal: 2,664,218

    -   After bot removal: 1,817,072

    -   **Drop**: 847,146 (31.8% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: A significant portion of views were bot-generated, indicating inflated traffic metrics.

-   **Addtocart**:

    -   Before bot removal: 68,966

    -   After bot removal: 22,947

    -   **Drop**: 46,019 (66.7% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: Bots contributed to addtocart actions, but less so compared to views.

-   **Transactions**:

    -   Before bot removal: 22,457

    -   After bot removal: 5,392

    -   **Drop**: 17,065 (75.9% reduction)

    -   **Implication**: Transactions were less affected by bots, suggesting more genuine human actions.

Analysis:

The large drop in views suggests that the website's traffic was significantly inflated by bots, which could affect advertising revenue and perceived popularity.

The drop in addtocart events indicates that user engagement might be lower than initially thought, suggesting a need to improve the user experience or product offerings.

The 75.9% reduction means that bots contributed heavily to transaction counts, but the remaining transactions after bot removal are likely more reliable as genuine human activity. This makes transactions a more trustworthy metric for evaluating real user behaviour, even though the absolute drop was large.

Data Preprocessing for item_properties**

```{r}
# Bind item properties 1 & 2 in a data frame
item_properties <- do.call(rbind, c(item_properties_1, item_properties_2))
```

```{r}
# Data Cleaning for item properties
# Check for duplicates in item_properties
# sum(duplicated(item_properties))
```

```{r}
# Check for NA's in item properties
# colSums(is.na(item_properties) | item_properties == "")
```

```{r}
# Convert to POSIXct
item_properties$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(item_properties$timestamp / 1000, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC")
```

**Merging cleaned_events and item_properties**

```{r}
# Merging datasets
# Perform a left Join
# A left join allows you to match each event with the most recent (previous) item property snapshot.

# Set event to data.table
setDT(cleaned_events)
setDT(item_properties)

# Order the data by itemid and timestamp
setorder(cleaned_events, itemid, timestamp)
setorder(item_properties, itemid, timestamp)

# leftjoin: for each event, get the most recent snapshot from item properties.
# This matches on 'itemid' and finds the snapshot with a timestamp less than or equal to the event timestamp.
events_items<- item_properties[cleaned_events, on = .(itemid, timestamp), roll = TRUE]
```

**Replace the categoryid in the property column with it corresponding value**

```{r}
# Update the 'property' column in events_items
# events_items[property == "categoryid", property := value]

# In the events_items data frame, update the 'property' column.
# For rows where 'property' equals "categoryid", replace it with the corresponding value from the 'value' column.
# Otherwise, keep the original 'property' value.
events_items <- events_items %>%
  mutate(property = if_else(property == "categoryid", 
                            value,     # Use the hashed value from 'value' column if property is "categoryid"
                            property)) # Otherwise, keep the original property

# Display the first few rows to verify the changes
# head(events_items)

```

**Merge events_items and categoryid**

```{r}
# Check the data types of the 'property' column in events_items and the 'categoryid' column in categorytree
str(events_items$property)
str(category_tree$categoryid)

# Convert both columns to character type to ensure they match
events_items <- events_items %>%
  mutate(property = as.character(property))
  
category_tree <- category_tree %>%
  mutate(categoryid = as.character(categoryid))

# Merge events_items with categorytree using a left join.
# This will attach the categorytree information to events_items where events_items$property matches categorytree$categoryid.
merged_df <- events_items %>%
  left_join(category_tree, by = c("property" = "categoryid"))

# Display the first few rows of the merged dataset to verify the result
# head(merged_df)

```

**Drop time_diff, hour, weekday from the merged_df**

```{r}
# Drop the columns "time_diff", "hour", and "weekday" from merged_df_all

  select(-time_diff, -hour, -weekday)
```

```{r}
# Rename column 'property' to 'categoryid'
final_df <- final_df %>% rename(categoryid = property)
```

**Filtered availability and created a new column to have only availability**

```{r}
# 1. Filter for available properties
merged_df_filtered <- merged_df %>%
  filter(property %in% c("available"))

# 2. Restructure or pivot the data so that each item has its categoryid & available as separate columns
merged_df_restructure <- merged_df_filtered %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = property, values_from = value)

# 3. Convert availability to numeric and then to integer (0 or 1)
# First, convert to numeric and replace NAs with 0
merged_df_restructure <- merged_df_restructure %>%
  mutate(available = as.numeric(available)) 

# Replace NA's in 'available' with 0, then convert to integer
merged_df_restructure$available[is.na(merged_df_restructure$available)] <- 0
merged_df_restructure <- merged_df_restructure %>%
  mutate(available = as.integer(available))

# Ensure only the latest available status per itemid is kept
merged_df_restructure <- merged_df_restructure %>%
  group_by(itemid) %>%
  arrange(desc(timestamp)) %>%  # Keep the latest timestamp per item
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Perform the left join safely
merged_df <- merged_df %>%

```

**Remove rows where categoryid is "available"**
